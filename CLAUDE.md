# StackRox Frontend Agent Skills

A portable AI brain for StackRox frontend engineering -- production-grade skills, agents, and references tailored for React 18.2, TypeScript 5.9, PatternFly 6, Apollo Client 3.8, Redux 4, and the StackRox UI codebase.

## Project Structure

```
skills/            → Core skills (SKILL.md per directory)
agents/            → Reusable agent personas (code-reviewer, test-engineer, security-auditor)
hooks/             → Hook documentation (SIMPLIFY-IGNORE.md)
.claude/commands/  → Slash commands (/spec, /plan, /build, /test, /review, /code-simplify, /ship)
references/        → Supplementary checklists (testing, performance, security, accessibility)
docs/              → getting-started.md, skill-anatomy.md
```

## Conventions

- Every skill lives in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- Description starts with what the skill does (third person), followed by trigger conditions ("Use when...")
- Every skill has: Overview, When to Use, Process, Common Rationalizations, Red Flags, Verification
- References are in `references/`, not inside skill directories
- Supporting files only created when content exceeds 100 lines

## Commands

- `npm test` — Not applicable (this is a documentation project)
- Validate: Check that all SKILL.md files have valid YAML frontmatter with name and description

## Boundaries

- Always: Follow the skill-anatomy.md format for new skills
- Never: Add skills that are vague advice instead of actionable processes
- Never: Duplicate content between skills — reference other skills instead
